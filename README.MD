**Exam module 3**

In this exam, we were tasked with different assignments to solve using the basic knowledge and functions we have learned throughout the course. The fist tasks went pretty well and was able to be solved succesfully. I also implemented a test method in each program, which I ran when testing out the different programs. The second task was a bit harder, but I managed after tinkering a little while and testing out the arrays, which I hoped I did correctly. Task 3 and 4 was something I struggled with quite a bit, but I managed to run the test succesfully on the third task which I hope I understood correctly and met the criteria. The fourth task gave me a lot of troubles, and even though I was mostly able to write out the functions I was not able to retrieve the JSON data for some reason, even though it is in the same folder and called by the correct name. I am not sure what I did wrong here though as the code should be correct, but I got several null errors and was not able to retrieve the JSON data after several tests.

Overall in the tasks I had to get a bit creative with the namespaces and change the names of the other main method to succesfully run the tests, so be wary of this if you are running the code directly from the folder.
